# TerpSyncAdmin
A tool to manage admin accounts for TerpSync

Created this a while ago when first released TerpSync. It is used to create new Admin accounts as well as managing accounts (e.g. resetting passwords, changing usernames).

Note: this app probably doesn't work, it was made in 15 minutes during a commute to campus. :P
